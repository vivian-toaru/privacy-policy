        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: January 2025</p>
        <p>VV Manga Translator (“the App”) is designed as a privacy-first manga translation tool. This Privacy Policy
            explains how the App handles your data and the safeguards applied to keep your information secure.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Data Collection &amp; Storage</h2>
        <div class="callout">
            <p>The App does not collect, transmit, or sell personal information. All content remains on your device.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manga images, translation results, and project metadata are stored locally on your device only.</li>
            <li>No personal data is uploaded to servers or synced with cloud services.</li>
            <li>The App does not require or offer account registration or user profiles.</li>
            <li>There is no built-in cloud backup; all processing occurs offline unless you request a translation from a
                third-party provider.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Network Usage</h2>
        <p>The App operates offline by default. Network access is used solely for outbound translation requests when you
            choose an online engine. These requests are limited to recognized Japanese text extracted from the selected
            manga page. Images or other media are never uploaded.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>If you enable online translation, the App can connect to the following services (subject to the API keys you
            configure):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Translate</li>
            <li>DeepSeek API</li>
            <li>OpenAI ChatGPT API</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each provider processes only the text you send and returns translation results. Please review their respective
            privacy policies for additional details. By using these services, you agree to their terms and data practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement the following safeguards to help protect your information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is written to local storage under your control.</li>
            <li>Removing the App does not automatically delete saved translations; you must delete the files manually if
                desired.</li>
            <li>We recommend creating regular backups of important translations if you plan to reinstall or migrate
                devices.</li>
            <li>API keys are supplied by you (or the developer build configuration) and stored securely within the App’s
                configuration; they are not shared with third parties beyond the selected translation service.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requests the minimal set of runtime permissions required for its core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage</strong> – access manga image files and store translation cache data.</li>
            <li><strong>Network</strong> – send text segments to online translation providers when you opt to use them.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>User Controls</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can clear all cached translations from the Settings screen at any time.</li>
            <li>Switching to the “Offline OCR” workflow ensures no network requests are issued.</li>
            <li>You may choose alternative translation engines or disable them entirely according to your privacy
                preferences.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App targets a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal data from children. Because no
            personal data is collected, parental consent frameworks are not required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have privacy-related questions or requests, please contact the project maintainers via the official
            repository issue tracker.</p>
    </section>

    <footer>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect product changes or legal requirements. Continued use of the App
            after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
