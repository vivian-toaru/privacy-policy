    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 12, 2026</div>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>VV Manga Screen OCR</strong> ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and
        ensuring the security of your data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our
        screen recognition services.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Usage</h2>

    <h3>Screen Content</h3>
    <p>The App utilizes the Android <code>MediaProjection</code> API to capture screen content for Optical Character
        Recognition (OCR). This feature is triggered <strong>only</strong> when you explicitly tap the floating capture
        button or select an area on your screen.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To extract text (specifically Japanese characters) from the selected screen area
            for your immediate use.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> All image processing is performed in real-time within the device's volatile
            memory (RAM).</li>
        <li><strong>No Storage:</strong> We do NOT save, store, or archive your screenshots on your device storage or
            any external servers. The image data is permanently discarded immediately after text extraction is complete.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User names, addresses, or phone numbers</li>
        <li>Contact lists or social media data</li>
        <li>Location data (GPS)</li>
        <li>Device identifiers (IMEI, MAC address) linked to your identity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>To function correctly, the App requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Screen Capture (MediaProjection):</strong> Required to capture the image of the text you wish to
            recognize. You must grant this permission each time you start a recognition session unless you choose "Don't
            show again" (on supported Android versions).</li>
        <li><strong>Foreground Service:</strong> Required to keep the floating overlay active and ready for your input
            while you use other apps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may utilize third-party OCR engines or translation APIs to provide high-accuracy text recognition.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Transmission:</strong> If cloud-based processing is required for enhanced accuracy, only the
            specific image crop you selected is transmitted securely via HTTPS.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Transmitted data contains no metadata that could identify you or your device.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Our third-party partners are contractually obligated not to use submitted
            images for training purposes or store them beyond the processing time required to return the result.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data during transmission and processing. Since
        we do not store your data, there is no risk of your screen captures being accessed from our servers in the event
        of a breach.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at
